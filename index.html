      <h2>What Do You Want to Do Today?</h2>
      <p>It's the eternal question, passed down through the ages. What <em>are</em> we going to do this weekend? After all, there's only so many times you can try to take over the world before it starts to get a bit repetitive. And now that there's a taco truck on every corner, dinner's already taken care of. So, what to do, what to do? Let us help! Just look through the categories that interest you to see what's happening. Then send them to your friends!</p>
      <p>The Venture Event Finder is the end of boredom. Get out there!</p>
