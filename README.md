# Code 201 Group Project
##"Event Picker"

* Problem Statement: it can be difficult to narrow down events when planning (for yourself or as a group)

* Benefits of our solution:
  ** Guides the user through a series of event categories to eventually display available local listings - a practical way to get suggestions for a range of interests that also can be planned last minute
  ** Saves chosen events to list summary (stretch: calendar)
  ** Provides direct navigation to page of the specific event (i.e., ticket page of sports team)
  ** Can be built on with sharing capacity
